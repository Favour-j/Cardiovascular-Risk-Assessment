# 🫀 Cardiovascular Risk Assessment Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a **Cardiovascular Risk Assessment Dashboard** built using **Power BI**, designed to analyze patient survival outcomes and key cardiovascular risk factors such as age, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and lifestyle or medical conditions.

The goal of this project is to provide **clear, interactive insights** that help understand survival patterns and risk distribution across different age groups and conditions.

## 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset was **pre-cleaned** and prepared for analysis before importing into Power BI. It contains patient-level cardiovascular health data, including:

* Age
* Gender
* Survival status
* Serum creatinine levels
* Ejection fraction
* Smoking status
* High blood pressure
* Anaemia
* Diabetes

The cleaned structure allowed for efficient modeling and visualization without extensive preprocessing in Power BI.

---

## 📈 Key Metrics & Insights

The dashboard highlights the following KPIs and analyses:

* **Overall Survival Rate**
* **Total Survival & Total Death Count**
* **Average Age of Survival**
* **Survival Count by Age Group**
* **Average Serum Creatinine by Age Group**
* **Average Ejection Fraction by Age Group**
* **Survival Rate Trend by Age Group**
* **Impact of Smoking, High Blood Pressure, Anaemia & Diabetes Across Ages**

These metrics help identify **high-risk age groups** and how specific health conditions influence survival outcomes.

## 🧠 Business Problem & Insights

### ❓ Problem Statement

Cardiovascular diseases remain one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Healthcare providers and analysts often face challenges in **identifying high-risk patient groups**, understanding how **age and clinical factors impact survival**, and communicating these insights clearly for data-driven decision-making.

Raw patient data alone makes it difficult to:

* Detect survival patterns across age groups
* Understand how clinical indicators (ejection fraction, serum creatinine) change with age
* Assess the combined impact of lifestyle and medical conditions on mortality risk

This dashboard was built to **transform complex cardiovascular health data into actionable insights**.

---

### 💡 Business & Analytical Insights

Using interactive visuals and KPI-driven analysis, the dashboard reveals that:

* **Survival rates decline significantly with increasing age**, with the sharpest drops observed in older age groups.
* **Average ejection fraction decreases as age increases**, indicating worsening cardiac efficiency among higher-risk patients.
* **Serum creatinine levels tend to rise in older age groups**, suggesting increased kidney strain, which correlates with lower survival outcomes.
* Patients with **underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, anaemia, and smoking habits** show noticeably lower survival distributions, especially when combined with older age.
* Certain age groups contribute disproportionately to total deaths, helping stakeholders focus preventive care and early intervention strategies.

---

### 🎯 Business Value

This dashboard helps stakeholders:

* ✅ Identify **high-risk cardiovascular patient segments**
* ✅ Support **preventive healthcare planning** and early interventions
* ✅ Improve communication of complex medical data to non-technical audiences
* ✅ Enable **data-informed decision-making** for healthcare management and policy discussions
